# MultipeerHelper

MultipeerConnectivity can be a big pill for developers to swallow. This package aims to simplify the creation of a multi-peer experience, while still delivering the full power of Apple's API.

## Installation

This is a Swift Package, and can be installed via Xcode with the URL of this repository:

`git@github.com:maxxfrazer/MultipeerHelper.git`

[For more information on how to add a Swift Package using Xcode, see Apple's official documentation.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app)


## Usage

To use this package, all you have to do is import `MultipeerHelper` and initialise the object:

```swift
self.multipeerHelp = MultipeerHelper(
  serviceName: "helper-test"
)
```

To extend this to RealityKit's synchronization service, simply add the following:

```swift
self.arView.scene.synchronizationService = self.multipeerHelp.syncService
```

And also make sure that your ARConfiguration's isCollaborationEnabled property is set to true.

### Initializer Parameters

#### serviceName
This is the type of service to advertise or search for. Due to how MultipeerConnectivity uses it, it should have the following restrictions:
 - Must be 1â€“15 characters long
 - Can contain only ASCII lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
 - Must contain at least one ASCII letter
 - Must not begin or end with a hyphen
 - Must not contain hyphens adjacent to other hyphens.

#### sessionType
This lets the service know if it should be acting as a service `host` (advertiser), `peer` (browser), or in a scenario where it doesn't matter, `both`. The default for this parameter is `both`, which is the scenario where all devices want to just connect to each other with no questions asked.

#### delegate
This delegate object will inherit the `MultipeerHelperDelegate` protocol, which can be used for all the handling of transferring data round the network and seeing when others join and leave.
